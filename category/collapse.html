<p>On August 18, 1991, a group of hardline Communist Party members attempted to seize power from Gorbachev. This group, known as the State Committee on the State of Emergency, placed Gorbachev under house arrest at his vacation home in Foros, Crimea. They opposed his reform policies and sought to restore the old Soviet order.</p>

<h2>Gorbachev’s Resistance</h2>
<p>Despite being isolated, Gorbachev refused to give in to the coup plotters’ demands. His defiance was a crucial moment, signaling the weakening grip of the old guard of the Communist Party.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Yeltsin’s Defiance</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin, then President of the Russian SFSR, emerged as a key figure in opposing the coup. He famously stood atop a tank outside the Russian White House, defying the coup plotters and rallying the public against them. This act of bravery was pivotal in undermining the coup’s legitimacy and galvanizing public support for reform.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>The Coup’s Failure</h2>
<p>The coup collapsed within three days due to the lack of support from the military and the general public. The failure of the coup accelerated the disintegration of the Soviet Union, as it exposed the vulnerabilities of the Communist Party’s control.</p>
<h2>The Belavezha Accords</h2>
<p>In December 1991, leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords, declaring the Soviet Union dissolved and establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. This was a formal acknowledgment of the end of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics</p>
