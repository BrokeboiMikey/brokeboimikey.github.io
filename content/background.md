## Political Stagnation and Economic Troubles
The 1980s were marked by political stagnation and economic troubles within the Soviet Union. **The centralized command economy**, once the engine of rapid industrialization, had become inefficient and unable to adapt to the changing global landscape. This period, known as **the Era of Stagnation**, saw the Soviet leadership grappling with declining growth rates, a lack of innovation, and increasing public dissatisfaction.

In response to these challenges, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, introduced groundbreaking reforms known as **Perestroika (restructuring)** and **Glasnost (openness)**. Perestroika aimed to revitalize the economy through the introduction of market-like reforms and reducing the government’s control over businesses. Glasnost, on the other hand, allowed for greater transparency and freedom of information, fostering a climate of open discussion and critique.

## Lead to collapse
These reforms, while intended to strengthen socialism and the Soviet state, inadvertently accelerated its dissolution. The loosening of governmental controls led to the rise of nationalism and the eventual independence of the Soviet republics. By December 1991, the Soviet Union had officially ceased to exist, marking the end of the Cold War era.
